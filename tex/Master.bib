	abstract = {In this paper, we examined the impact of project-level configurational choices of globally distributed software teams on project productivity, quality, and profits. Our analysis used data from 362 projects of four different firms. These projects spanned a wide range of programming languages, application domain, process choices, and development sites spread over 15 countries and 5 continents. Our analysis revealed fundamental tradeoffs in choosing configurational choices that are optimized for productivity, quality, and/or profits. In particular, achieving higher levels of productivity and quality require diametrically opposed configurational choices. In addition, creating imbalances in the expertise and personnel distribution of project teams significantly helps increase profit margins. However, a profit-oriented imbalance could also significantly affect productivity and/or quality outcomes. Analyzing these complex tradeoffs, we provide actionable managerial insights that can help software firms and their clients choose configurations that achieve desired project outcomes in globally distributed software development.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a semi-automated method for extracting the associations among components of a complex engineering project by mining transcripts of design discussions about the engineered artifact. We contribute a novel method for deriving network data from communication data. This method uses relational text analysis to construct networks representing associations among designed pieces of the artifact. Our analysis shows that association networks extracted with this method correlate highly with those extracted by humans, and those constructed based on expert interviews. This method can help scholars and practitioners understand the nature and evolution of the relationship between tasks and components, and the successful execution of complex projects. The association networks produced by our method can be used to reveal key properties of the project and may suggest the coordination required among project members. Collaboration technologies could potentially take advantage of these networks to infer gaps in actual coordination, discover changes in dependencies among team members as they emerge, and suggest appropriate courses of action to managers and people whose work is related. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

There is a potential for this transparency to radically improve collaboration and learning in complex knowledge-based activities. Based on a series of in-depth interviews with central and peripheral {GitHub} users, we examined the value of transparency for large-scale distributed collaborations and communities of practice. We find that people make a surprisingly rich set of social inferences from the networked activity information in {GitHub}, such as inferring someone else's technical goals and vision when they edit code, or guessing which of several similar projects has the best chance of thriving in the long term. Users combine these inferences into effective strategies for coordinating work, advancing technical skills and managing their reputation.},

	abstract = {Open-Source Software ({OSS)} development is regarded as a successful model of encouraging "natural product evolution". To understand how this "natural product evolution" happens, we have conducted a case study of four typical {OSS} projects. Unlike most previous studies on software evolution that focus on the evolution of the system per se, our study takes a broader perspective: It examines not only the evolution of {OSS} systems, but also the evolution of the associated {OSS} communities, as well as the relationship between the two types of {evolution.Through} the case study, we have found that while collaborative development within a community is the essential characteristic of {OSS}, different collaboration models exist, and that the difference in collaboration model results in different evolution patterns of {OSS} systems and communities. To treat such differences systematically, we propose to classify {OSS} into three types: Exploration-Oriented, Utility-Oriented, and Service-Oriented. Such a classification can provide guidance on the creation and maintenance of sustainable {OSS} development and communities.},

The study suggests that members of innovative online communities learn and build collective knowledge through the use of ‘technologies’ and the establishment of discursive practices that enable virtual re-experience. Theories of knowledge creation and learning have been reviewed and a social-experiential view of learning has been applied in order to examine the reflective inquiry processes and collective learning practices. The findings demonstrate that re-experience is enabled by code, transactive group memory, instructive content and discourse, and reflective discourse. The manifestations of learning processes lead to concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation at the individual level. Collective reflection, collective conceptualization, virtual experimentation, and participative practice are initiated at the social level. Empirical evidence is based on an interpretive investigation of the K Desktop Environment ({KDE)} community—an open-source software project that is administered online.},

In this work, however, we propose a developer-module relationship model to analyze the grouping structures between developers and modules. Our results show some process cases of relative importance on the constructed graph of project development.

Past analyses and discussions, however, have treated {OSS} projects and their organization mostly as a static phenomenon. Consequently, we do not know how these communities of software developers are sustained and reproduced over time through the progressive integration of new members. To shed light on this issue I report on my analyses of socialization in a particular {OSS} community. In particular, I document the relationships {OSS} newcomers develop over time with both the social and material aspects of a project. To do so, I combine two mutually informing activities: ethnography and the use of software specially designed to visualize and explore the interacting networks of human and material resources incorporated in the email and code databases of {OSS.} Socialization in this community is analyzed from two perspectives: as an individual learning process and as a political process. From these analyses it appears that successful participants progressively construct identities as software craftsmen, and that this process is punctuated by specific rites of passage. Successful participants also understand the political nature of software development and progressively enroll a network of human and material allies to support their efforts. I conclude by discussing how these results could inform the design of software to support socialization in {OSS} projects, as well as practical implications for the future of these projects.},

	abstract = {In this paper we report on the results of a study of the effort and motivations of individuals to contributing to the creation of {Free/Open} Source software. We used a Web-based survey, administered to 684 software developers in 287 {F/OSS} projects, to learn what lies behind the effort put into such projects. Academic theorizing on individual motivations for participating in {F/OSS} projects has posited that external motivational factors in the form of extrinsic benefits (e.g.: better jobs, career advancement) are the main drivers of effort. We find in contrast, that enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation, namely how creative a person feels when working on the project, is the strongest and most pervasive driver. We also find that user need, intellectual stimulation derived from writing code, and improving programming skills are top motivators for project participation. A majority of our respondents are skilled and experienced professionals working in {IT-related} jobs, with approximately 40 percent being paid to participate in the {F/OSS} project.},

By placing emphasis on the whole person, and by viewing agent, activity, and world as mutually constitutive, they give us the opportunity to escape from the tyranny of the assumption that learning is the reception of factual knowledge or information. The authors argue that most accounts of learning have ignored its quintessentially social character. To make the crucial step away from a solely epistemological account of the person, they propose that learning is a process of participation in communities of practice, participation that is at first legitimately peripheral but that increases gradually in engagement and complexity. Learning viewed as situated activity has as its central defining characteristic a process that we call legitimate peripheral participation. By this we mean to draw attention to the point that learners inevitably participate in communities of practitioners and that the mastery of knowledge and skill requires newcomers to move toward full participation in the sociocultural practice of a community. . . . A person's intentions to learn are engaged and the meaning of learning is configured through the process of becoming a full participant in a sociocultural practice.},

However, little work to date has examined how individuals use social network functionality for professional development in these types of communities. We present a qualitative investigation into how the social transparency provided by {SNS} functionality influences two important components of professional activity: social learning and professional identity development. We focus on activity within Dribbble, a social media enabled community of practice for graphic designers. Through a series of interviews with novice and experienced Dribbble users who work within and outside of traditional organizations, we identified ways they leverage social media features for learning and skill development. We find that benefits of the site are dependent on extensive social capital development activities in order to garner attention for posted work. Our results inform the design of online social settings for professional development.},

	abstract = {An Open Source Software ({OSS)} project is unlikely to be successful unless there is an accompanied community that provides the platform for developers and users to collaborate. Members of such communities are volunteers whose motivation to participate and contribute is of essential importance to the success of {OSS} projects. In this paper, we aim to create an understanding of what motivates people to participate in {OSS} communities. We theorize that learning is one of the motivational forces. Our theory is grounded in the learning theory of Legitimate Peripheral Participation, and is supported by analyzing the social structure of {OSS} communities and the co-evolution between {OSS} systems and communities. We also discuss practical implications of our theory for creating and maintaining sustainable {OSS} communities as well as for software engineering research and education.},

It does not focus on specific properties or technical attributes of different {FOSS} systems, but it does seek to explore how {FOSS} is developed and evolved. The chapter provides a brief background on what {FOSS} is and how free software and open source software development efforts are similar and different. From there attention shifts to an extensive review of a set of empirical studies of {FOSSD} that articulate different levels of analysis. These characterize what has been analyzed in {FOSSD} studies across levels that examine why individuals participate; resources and capabilities supporting development activities; how cooperation, coordination, and control are realized in projects; alliance formation and inter-project social networking; {FOSS} as a multi-project software ecosystem, and {FOSS} as a social movement. Following this, the chapter reviews how different research methods are employed to examine different issues in {FOSSD.} These include reflective practice and industry polls, survey research, ethnographic studies, mining {FOSS} repositories, and multi-modal modeling and analysis of {FOSSD} processes and socio-technical networks. Finally, there is a discussion of limitations and constraints in the {FOSSD} studies so far, attention to emerging opportunities for future {FOSSD} studies, and then conclusions about what is known about {FOSSD} through the empirical studies reviewed here.},

But what are the underlying principles allowing online creative collaboration to succeed, and how well do they transfer from one domain to another? In this paper, we address these questions by comparing and contrasting online, collaborative animated movies, called collabs, with {OSS} projects. First, we use qualitative methods to solicit potential success factors from collab participants. Then, we test these predictions by quantitatively analyzing a data set of nearly 900 collabs. Finally, we compare and contrast our results with the literature on {OSS} development and propose broader theoretical implications. Our findings offer a starting point for a systematic research agenda seeking to unlock the potential of online creative collaboration.},
